# Scrape Genius Lyrics

My first attempt at Webscraping.  
You can add Artists to a List and after some time, get a json file with all Words used by that Artist in all Songs on Genius.com  
I do not recommend using this Script for anything except inspiration.  
There are other repositories on Github who do the same thing but a lot smarter and quicker.
